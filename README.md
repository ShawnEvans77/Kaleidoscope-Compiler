The difference between an amateur and a professional is that you write your own compiler... so I'll learn how to write
my own compiler!

This repository contains my journey learning how to make a compiler. The main compiler being developed here is a Kaleidoscope 
compiler. You can view the compiler source in the compiler directory.

It also functions as a toy repository where I can learn CPP and Assembly. My areas of focus will be memory management and the CPP
std library. As I work on my compiler, I work on toy programs to understand what I am writing.
